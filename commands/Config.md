# git config

When first setting up a fit, you'll need to work wiht the git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:

```
git config --global user.name "Arnold Shortman"
git config --global usrt.email arnoldshortman2020@gmail.com
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
